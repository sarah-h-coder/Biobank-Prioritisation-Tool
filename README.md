# Biobank-Prioritisation-Tool

A prototype application that ranks species for conservation and research based on their conversation value, demand for samples by the community, and the samples already in biobank storage. This priority system assists biobanks with their resource allocation by prioritising species for resources, enabling them to enhance the diversity and availability of zoological samples for conservation and research. The application is in ongoing development and may therefore throw up bugs and unexpected errors.

## Getting started
To get started with the app, read the [installation guide](installation.md). Once you've installed the app, you can run it from the CMD with `python app.py`.

### Supported Operating Systems
- [x] Windows
- [ ] Mac
- [x] Linux

## What to expect
Once the application has been installed and `app.py` is running, users can navigate to the website by clicking the link to the host from CMD. The website has a landing page called 'home' which provides a brief overview of the project. To see other pages such as 'dataset' and 'upload' page, go to the navigation bar at the top of the page and click on the page links. 

When you first click on the 'dataset' page is will re-direct you to the upload page, here you can upload the CryoArks (biobank sample) data located in the /datasets folder of this app. The added sample data will be displayed alongside the other categories in the dataset page, and it will contribute to the priority score calculated for each species. In the image below, you can see the CryoArks data being displayed in the upload page.

The dataset page displays scores for each category: Conservation Value (CV), Demand, and Biobank Samples. In addition, the class of each species, percentage of missing data (from the CV score) and the priority score derived from the category scores are displayed for each species. You can download the displayed data in the dataset page using the download button, all downloads can be found in the /downloaded folder inside the project folder. If you have trouble locates files in this project, then have a look at the [Project Structure](project-structure.md).

## Note to developers
This project is still under development and may have some teething issues. 
If you run into a bug, please let me know and I will look into fixing it.

If you are interested in contributing to this project then please contact the [author](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-j-harwood) of the tool.

### Future development
This project is in ongoing development. The previous version was developed on the request to have the data in SQL for frequent access and use in other projects. This current version allows user to specify if they want to use an optional SQL database to store the data.

There are some areas I am planning to work on in future editions:
- Replacing fake demand scores with real demand/ request data
- Improving error messaging for more precise error handling
- Handling missing data effectively so it doesn't cause artificially low scores
- Enforcing more rigorous data health checks to avoid unexpected errors/ bugs
